# control, you can switch to the traditional method.
DeclarativeBase = declarative_base()

# There are two convenient ways for you to spare some typing.
# You can have a query property on all your model classes by doing this:
# DeclarativeBase.query = DBSession.query_property()
# Or you can use a session-aware mapper as it was used in TurboGears 1:
# DeclarativeBase = declarative_base(mapper=DBSession.mapper)

# Global metadata.
# The default metadata is the one from the declarative base.
metadata = DeclarativeBase.metadata

# If you have multiple databases with overlapping table names, you'll need a
# metadata for each database. Feel free to rename 'metadata2'.
#metadata2 = MetaData()

#####
# Generally you will not want to define your table's mappers, and data objects
# here in __init__ but will want to create modules them in the model directory
# and import them at the bottom of this file.

    # the init_model function, so that the engine is available if you
    # use the model outside tg2, you need to make sure this is called before
    # you use the model.

    #global t_reflected

    #t_reflected = Table("Reflected", metadata,
    #    autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

    #mapper(Reflected, t_reflected)
